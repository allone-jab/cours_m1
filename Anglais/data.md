# Data Religion Synthesis

Data processing has to be shared to be optimal. 
Data is everywhere, in every single actions that are taken, things that exist and events that happen every day.
In today's world, data is the key to most of the decisions that are being taken. These days, whether it is in international Stock Echanges or the local butchery or bakery as Yuval Noah Harari says, data will be used to determine the best way  to act in order to add value or perennity to what is being producted.

Analyzing data helps our society to learn from our behaviour and how it affects the world and the behaviour of others. With data, we can learn how to prevent dangerous behaviours by a deep analysis.  
Linked to technology, data becomes a goldmine. After collecting and analyzing data, we can create models that will adapt to beahaviours. Just think about that fridge that will automatically buy on the internet your favourite drink and dessert, - more actual - the car that will allow you totake a long trip without touching the wheel because it has been taught how to drive perfectly through data.

Yuval Noah Harari enlightens in this part that the reason why Soviets lost the Cold War is partly because their data processing was centralized and, therefore, it caused a bad communication that made their productivity decrease over time.
